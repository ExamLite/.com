        <p class="landing-description">I started this website in late 2023 as a way to learn WebDev in my free time. If only I knew how time consuming this would be before I started.</p> 
        <p class="landing-description"> Ultimately, my goal is to provide a free source of study material for anyone who needs it.
        No catch. No logins. No subscriptions.</p>
        <p class="landing-description"> CompTIA <a href="https://store.comptia.org/comptia-security-sy0-701-complete-bundle/p/SEC-701-BDCO-24-C?utm_campaign=nam-consumer-completesecurity-search-sales-purchase&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=google&utm_term=comptia%20security%2B%20sale-e&utm_content=701684738611&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmMC6BhA6EiwAdN5iLVoBLE9zuYbUz3-oRov_H1mS88RmPFkK3kcsGEDpUuISOTvfBXQd-xoC0ncQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">
            sells study guides</a> in the upwards of $1000. 
            It is their exam and they have every right to do so. 
            Lets be honest, most people who are trying to get their Sec+ cert can't afford to drop that kind of money on a study guide package.
            Unfortunately, having the Sec+ cert is a pre-requisite for getting your foot in the door at a lot of places now. 
            <span style="font-weight:bold">I don't think your financial status should hold you back from progressing in your career.</span></p>

            <p class="landing-description">Whether you're a broke kid looking to make a career change; A military member transitioning into the civilian world; Some other 3rd thing! 
            I invite you to use this site as a free resource to work toward your certs.
            Bear with me as I prepare this website to provide you with everything you need to pass. </p>
